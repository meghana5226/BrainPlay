##  **Types of Numbers**

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Integers** | Numbers with no fractional part | -3, -2, -1, 0, 5, 10 |
| **Natural Numbers** | Counting numbers > 0 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... |
| **Whole Numbers** | Natural numbers + 0 | 0, 1, 2, 3... |
| **Prime Numbers** | Only two factors → 1 and itself | 2, 3, 5, 7, 11... |
| **Composite Numbers** | Non-prime numbers > 1 | 4, 6, 9, 10... |
| **Co-Primes** | HCF = 1 | (8, 9), (5, 7) |

>  **Note:**  
> - 0 and 1 are neither prime nor composite.  
> - 2 is the only even prime number.  
> - 25 prime numbers exist below 100.

##  **Divisibility Rules**

| Divisible By | Rule | Example |
|---------------|------|----------|
| **2** | Last digit even | 124 ✅ |
| **3** | Sum of digits divisible by 3 | 12321 ✅ (1+2+3+2+1=9) |
| **4** | Last 2 digits divisible by 4 | 1232 ✅ (32 ÷ 4 = 8) |
| **5** | Ends with 0 or 5 | 85 ✅ |
| **6** | Divisible by both 2 & 3 | 114 ✅ |
| **7** | Double last digit, subtract from rest | 196 ✅ |
| **8** | Last 3 digits divisible by 8 | 1232 ✅ |
| **9** | Sum of digits divisible by 9 | 12321 ✅ |
| **11** | Difference of (odd-even position sums) = 0 or multiple of 11 | 121 ✅ |

##  **Remainder Rules**

| Dividing By | Quick Trick | Example |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **2** | Odd → 1, Even → 0 | 37 → R=1 |
| **3** | Sum of digits → mod 3 | 23 → R=2 |
| **4** | Last 2 digits → mod 4 | 123 → R=3 |
| **5** | Last digit → mod 5 | 32 → R=2 |
| **6** | Apply rules of 2 and 3 | 35 → R=5 |
| **7** | Alternate method (mod 7) | 198 → R=2 |
| **8** | Last 3 digits → mod 8 | 1476 → R=4 |
| **9** | Sum digits → mod 9 | 1234 → R=1 |

##  **Division Theorem**
\[
\text{Dividend} = (\text{Divisor} × \text{Quotient}) + \text{Remainder}
\]

**Key Results:**
1. \( (x^n - a^n) \) divisible by \( (x - a) \)
2. \( (x^n - a^n) \) divisible by \( (x + a) \) if n is even
3. \( (x^n + a^n) \) divisible by \( (x + a) \) if n is odd

## 🔄 **Cyclicity of Numbers**

| Digit | Pattern (Cyclicity) |
|--------|---------------------|
| 0, 1, 5, 6 | Always same |
| 4 | 4 → 6 → 4 → 6 |
| 9 | 9 → 1 → 9 → 1 |
| 2 | 2 → 4 → 8 → 6 |
| 3 | 3 → 9 → 7 → 1 |
| 7 | 7 → 9 → 3 → 1 |
| 8 | 8 → 4 → 2 → 6 |
