# 🧠 **BrainPlay — Where Aptitude Meets Smart Thinking**

Because learning should feel like a game — play, puzzle, and power up your brain!

Aptitude refers to your **natural ability to solve problems**, while reasoning is the **method you use to think, analyze, and arrive at conclusions**.

In simple words:
👉 **Aptitude = Talent to think**
👉 **Reasoning = Path to the answer**

When you face a tricky question, your *aptitude* makes you curious — your *reasoning* finds the logic.
